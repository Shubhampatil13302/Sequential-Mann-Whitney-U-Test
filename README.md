This M.Sc. Statistics project focused on developing a sequential version of the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U Test to enable real-time decision-making with reduced sample sizes. The goal was to construct a method with early stopping boundaries (a, b) to accept or reject hypotheses efficiently while maintaining statistical power. A recursive test statistic was proposed, and simulation-based regression models were used to estimate optimal boundaries for various significance levels. The test was evaluated under Normal, Laplace, Lognormal, and Shifted Exponential distributions. Performance metrics included Type I error, power, ASN, and the Power-to-ASN Ratio (PAR). Results showed substantial sample size reduction and high efficiency, especially in skewed and symmetric distributions, confirming its potential in clinical, industrial, and fraud detection settings. Tools used included R, Python, Excel, and custom simulation scripts.
